I’m a **production-ready Full-Stack JavaScript Engineer** with extensive real-world experience building, deploying, and maintaining scalable web applications.

My core expertise lies in **React and Node.js**, where I’ve delivered complex, performance-critical UIs directly from Figma designs and engineered backend systems involving **real-time collaboration, authentication-heavy workflows, payments, and background processing**. I’ve built and operated systems such as a **real-time collaborative code editor** and a **scalable e-commerce platform**, owning everything from system design to production monitoring.

I’m comfortable working across the entire stack — designing **REST and GraphQL APIs**, implementing secure auth flows, optimizing performance, and debugging long-running production systems. On the infrastructure side, I deploy and maintain applications on **Linux servers** using **Docker, Nginx, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms**, with working knowledge of **Kubernetes and observability tools**.

I thrive in structured engineering environments, value clean architecture and maintainability, and enjoy solving complex problems that arise in real-world, production systems. I’m currently focused on building high-impact software and contributing to teams that care deeply about quality, scalability, and engineering discipline.
